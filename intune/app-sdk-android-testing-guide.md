# Microsoft Intune App SDK for Android developers testing guide

The Microsoft Intune App SDK for Android testing guide is designed to help you test your Intune-managed Android app.  

## Prerequisite test accounts
New accounts can be created with and without pre-generated data. To create a new account:
1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Demos](https://demos.microsoft.com/environments/create/tenant) site. 
2. [Set up Intune](setup-steps.md) to enable mobile device management (MDM).
3. [Create users](users-add.md).
4. [Create groups](groups-add.md).
5. [Assign licenses](licenses-assign.md) as appropriate for your testing.


## Azure portal policy configuration
[Create and assign app protection policies](app-protection-policies.md) in the [Azure portal's Intune blade](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#blade/Microsoft_Intune_Apps/MainMenu/14/selectedMenuItem/Overview). Your [app configuration policy](app-configuration-policies-overview.md) can also be created and assigned in the Intune blade.

> [!NOTE]
> If your app is not listed in the Azure portal, you can target it with a policy by selecting the **more apps** option and providing the package name in the text box.

## Test Cases

The following test cases provide configuration and confirmation steps. Use this guidance to help troubleshoot Intune-managed Android app issues.

### Required PIN and corporate credentials

You can require a pin to access corporate resources. Also, you can enforce corporate authentication before users can use managed apps. Use the following steps to set these requirements:

1. Configure **Require PIN for access** and **Require corporate credentials for access** to **Yes**. For more information, see [Android app protection policy settings in Microsoft Intune](app-protection-policy-settings-android.md#access-requirements).
2. Confirm the following conditions:
    - App launch should present a prompt for PIN input/setup and/or the production user that was used during enrollment with the Company Portal.
    - Failure to present a valid sign-in prompt could be due to an incorrectly configured android manifest, specifically the values for ADAL integration (SkipBroker, ClientID, and Authority).
    - Failure to present any prompt could be due to an incorrectly integrated `MAMActivity` value. For more information about `MAMActivity`, see [Microsoft Intune App SDK for Android developer guide](app-sdk-android.md).

> [!NOTE] 
> If the above test is not working, the tests below will likely also fail. Review [SDK](app-sdk-android.md##sdk-integration) and [ADAL](app-sdk-android.md#configure-azure-active-directory-authentication-library-adal) integration.

### Restrict transferring and receiving data with other apps
You can control data transfer between corporate managed applications as follows:

1. Set **Allow app to transfer data to other apps** to **Policy-managed apps**.
2. Set **Allow app to receive data from other apps** to **All apps**. Use of intents and content providers will be impacted by these policies.
3. Confirm the following conditions:
    - Opening from an unmanaged app into your app functions correctly.
    - Sharing content between managed apps is allowed.
    - Sharing from managed apps to non-managed apps (for example, Chrome) is blocked.

### Restrict cut, copy, and paste
You can restrict the system clipboard to managed applications as follows:

1. Set **Restrict cut, copy, and paste with other apps** to **Policy managed with paste in**.
2. Confirm the following conditions:
    - Copying text from your app into a managed an unmanaged app (for example, Messages) is blocked.

### Prevent **Save As**
You can control **save as** functionality as follows:

1. If your app requires [integrated 'save as' controls](app-sdk-android.md#example-determine-if-saving-to-device-or-cloud-storage-is-permitted), set **Prevent 'Save As'** to **Yes**.
2. Confirm the following conditions:
    - Save is restricted to only appropriate managed locations.

### File Encryption
You can encrypt data on the device as follows:

1. Set **Encrypt app data** to **Yes**.
2. Confirm the following conditions:
    - Normal application behavior is not impacted.

### Prevent Android Backups
You can control app backup as follows:

1. If you have set [integrated backup restrictions](app-sdk-android.md#protecting-backup-data), configure **Prevent Android backups** to **Yes**.
2. Confirm the following conditions:
    - Backups are restricted.

### Unenrollment
You can remotely wipe managed apps from containing corporate email and documents and personal data is decrypted when it is no longer administered as follows:

1. From the Azure portal, [issue a wipe](apps-selective-wipe.md).
2. If your app does not register for any wipe handlers confirm the following conditions:
    - A full wipe of the app occurs.
3. If your app has registered for `WIPE_USER_DATA` or `WIPE_USER_AUXILARY_DATA`, confirm the following conditions:
    - The managed content is removed from the app. For more information, see [Intune App SDK for Android developer guide - Selective Wipe](app-sdk-android.md#selective-wipe).

### Multi-Identity
Integrating [multi-identity support](app-sdk-android.md#multi-identity-optional) is a high risk change that needs to be thoroughly tested. The most common issues will be due to improper setting of the identity (context vs. threat level) and also tracking files (`MAMFileProtectionManager`).

Minimally the following scenarios for multi-identity should be revalidated:

- **Save As** policy is working correctly for managed identities.
- Copy paste restrictions are correctly enforced from managed to personal.
- Only data belonging to the managed identity is encrypted and personal files are not modified.
- Selective wipe during unenrollment only removes the managed identity data.
- The end user is prompted for conditional launch when changing from unmanaged to managed account (first time only).

### App configuration (optional)
You can configure behavior of managed apps as follows:

1. If your app consumes any app configuration settings, you should test that your app correctly handles all values that you (as the admin) can set. [App configuration policies](app-configuration-policies-overview.md) can be created and assigned in using Intune.

## Next steps

- [Add an Android line-of-business app to Microsoft Intune](lob-apps-android.md).
