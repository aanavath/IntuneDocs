# Microsoft Intune App SDK Xamarin Component

> [!NOTE]
> You may wish to first read the [Get Started with Intune App SDK](app-sdk-get-started.md) article, which explains how to prepare for integration on each supported platform.



## Overview
The [Intune App SDK Xamarin component](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-sdk-xamarin) enables [Intune app protection policy](/intune-classic/deploy-use/protect-app-data-using-mobile-app-management-policies-with-microsoft-intune) in iOS and Android apps built with Xamarin. The component allows developers to easily build in Intune app protection features into their Xamarin-based app.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for the Intune SDK for Xamarin is currently available in preview. 

The Microsoft Intune App SDK Xamarin Component lets you incorporate Intune app protection policies (also known as APP or MAM policies) into your apps developed with Xamarin. A MAM-enabled application is one that is integrated with the Intune App SDK. IT administrators can deploy app protection policies to your mobile app when Intune actively manages the app.

## What's supported?

### Developer machines
* macOS


### Mobile app platforms
* Android
* iOS


### Intune Mobile Application Management scenarios

* Intune MDM-enrolled devices
* Third-party EMM-enrolled devices
* Unmanaged devices (not enrolled with any MDM)

Xamarin apps built with the Intune App SDK Xamarin Component can now receive Intune app protection policies on both Intune mobile device management (MDM) enrolled devices and unenrolled devices.

## Prerequisites

* **[Android only]** The latest Microsoft Intune Company Portal app must be installed on the device.

## Get started

1.	Download **Xamarin-component.exe** from [here](https://components.xamarin.com/submit/xpkg) and extract it.

2. Read the [license terms](https://components.xamarin.com/license/microsoft.intune.mam) for the Microsoft Intune MAM Xamarin Component.

3.	Download the Intune App SDK Xamarin Component folder from [GitHub](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk/intune-app-sdk-xamarin) and extract it. Both files downloaded from step 1 and step 3 should be in the same directory level.

4.	In the command line as an administrator, run `Xamarin.Component.exe install <.xam> file`.

5.	In Visual Studio, right-click **components** in your previously created Xamarin project.

6.	Select **Edit Components** and add the Intune App SDK component you’ve downloaded locally to your computer.

## Enabling Intune app protection polices in your iOS mobile app
1.	Follow the general steps required for integrating the Intune App SDK into an iOS mobile app. You can begin with step 3 of the integration instructions from the [Intune App SDK for iOS Developer Guide](app-sdk-ios.md#build-the-sdk-into-your-mobile-app).
    **Important**: Enabling keychain sharing for an app is slightly different in Visual Studio from Xcode. Open the app's Entitlements plist and make sure the "Enable Keychain" option is enabled and the appropriate keychain sharing groups are added in that section. Then, ensure the Entitlements plist is specified in the "Custom Entitlements" field of the project's "iOS Bundle Signing" options for all the appropriate Configuration/Platform combinations.
2.	Once the component is added and the app is properly configured, your app can begin using the Intune SDK's APIs. To do so, you must include the following namespace:

      ```csharp
      using Microsoft.Intune.MAM;
      ```
3.    To begin receiving app protection policies, your app must enroll in the Intune MAM service. If your app already uses the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) to authenticate users, your app should provide the user's UPN to the IntuneMAMEnrollmentManager's registerAndEnrollAccount method after it has successfully authenticated:
      ```csharp
      IntuneMAMEnrollmentManager.Instance.RegisterAndEnrollAccount(string identity);
      ```
      **Important**: Be sure to override the Intune App SDK's default ADAL settings with those of your app. You can do so via the IntuneMAMSettings dictionary in the app's Info.plist, as mentioned in the [Intune App SDK for iOS Developer Guide](app-sdk-ios.md#configure-settings-for-the-intune-app-sdk), or you can use the AAD override properties of the IntuneMAMPolicyManager instance. The Info.plist approach is recommended for applications whose ADAL settings are static while the override properties are recommended for applications that determine those values at runtime. 
      
      If your app does not use ADAL, and you'd like the Intune SDK to handle authentication, your app should call the IntuneMAMEnrollmentManager's loginAndEnrollAccount method:
      ```csharp
       IntuneMAMEnrollmentManager.Instance.LoginAndEnrollAccount([NullAllowed] string identity);
      ```

## Enabling app protection policies in your Android mobile app
For Xamarin-based Android apps not using a UI framework, you need to read and follow the [Intune App SDK for Android Developer Guide](app-sdk-android.md). For your Xamarin-based Android app, you need to replace class, methods, and activities with their MAM equivalent based on the [table](app-sdk-android.md#replace-classes-methods-and-activities-with-their-mam-equivalent) included in the guide. If your app doesn’t define an `android.app.Application` class, you need to create one and ensure that you inherit from `MAMApplication`.

For Xamarin Forms and other UI frameworks, we have provided a tool called `MAM.Remapper`. The tool accomplishes the class replacement for you. However, you need to do the following steps:

1.  Add a reference to the `Microsoft.Intune.MAM.Remapper.Tasks` NuGet package version 0.1.0.0 or greater.

2.  Add the following line to your Android csproj:
  ```xml
  <Import
  Project="$(NugetPack)\\Microsoft.Intune.MAM.Remapper.Tasks.0.1.X.X\\build\\MonoAndroid10\\Microsoft.Intune.MAM.Remapper.targets" />
  ```

3.  Set the build action of the added `remapping-config.json` file to **RemappingConfigFile**. The included `remapping-config.json` only works with Xamarin.Forms. For other UI frameworks, refer to the Readme included with the Remapper NuGet package.

## Next steps

You have completed the basic steps of building the component into your app. Now you can follow the steps included in the Xamarin Android sample app. We have provided two samples, one for Xamarin.Forms and another for Android.
